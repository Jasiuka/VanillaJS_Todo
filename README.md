# Vanilla JavaScript "Todo list" web application

---

Just completed React.js course on udemy. Decided to make some simple projects by myself, but everytime with different technology, this way I will renew my knowledge of technology or learn something new, so I thought it would be a good practice.

There will be 2 simple projects:

1. "Todo list" web application
2. Weather web application

"Todo list" project features:

- Pages (delete page, add new, move through pages) max pages - 7 (for every week day)
- Saving data to local storage of the browser
- Editing todo
- Deleting todo
- Editing page title
- Adding new todo when "Enter" key is pressed

Weather application project features:

- soon..

Technologies I will use to build these projects:

- Vanilla JavaScript
- React.js
- React.js with TypeScript
- Svelte\*
- Vue.js

## This is the first project, "Todo list" web application with vanilla JavaScript
